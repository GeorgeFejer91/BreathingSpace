    "# This script integrates two key components of a Peripersonal Space (PPS) experiment:\n",
    "# 1. A counterbalancer that generates experimental designs with balanced conditions\n",
    "# 2. An audio generator that creates TWO participant-specific audio files with embedded stimuli:\n",
    "#    - First audio: Box breathing with embedded directional looming stimuli\n",
    "#    - Second audio: Synchronized tactile stimuli with applied SOA offsets\n",
    "#\n",
    "# PROJECT OVERVIEW:\n",
    "# This experiment investigates how breathing phases (inhalation/exhalation) influence \n",
    "# responses to looming stimuli in peripersonal space. The design presents auditory stimuli \n",

    "Peripersonal Space (PPS) Audio Stimuli Generator\n",
    "\n",
    "PROJECT OVERVIEW:\n",
    "This script is part of a cognitive neuroscience experiment investigating peripersonal space (PPS) \n",
    "perception during controlled breathing exercises. PPS refers to the space immediately surrounding \n",
    "the body that is integrated with tactile perception. The experiment aims to understand how PPS \n",
    "representation may change during different phases of breathing.\n",
    "\n",
    "PURPOSE:\n",
    "This script generates participant-specific audio files by injecting spatial audio stimuli \n",
    "(sounds that appear to come from specific directions) into a guided box breathing meditation \n",
    "audio track. Each participant receives a unique audio file where stimuli are presented at \n",
    "specific breathing hold phases with controlled randomization (jitter).\n",
    "\n",
    "EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN:\n",
    "1. Participants follow a guided box breathing meditation (inhale, hold, exhale, hold)\n",
    "2. During specific hold phases, 3D spatial audio stimuli are presented from different directions\n",
    "3. The timing of stimuli is precisely controlled but includes small random variations (jitter)\n",
    "   to prevent anticipation effects\n",
    "4. Each participant's design specifies which type of spatial audio stimuli (left/front/right)\n",
    "   should be presented during which breathing cycles\n",
    "\n",
    "STIMULI DESCRIPTION:\n",
    "- Base audio: A guided box breathing meditation instructing participants when to inhale, \n",
    "  hold, exhale, and hold\n",
    "- Spatial stimuli: 3D audio recordings using FABIAN HRIR (Head-Related Impulse Response) that\n",
    "  create perception of sounds approaching from three directions:\n",
    "  * Right (90° azimuth)\n",
    "  * Front (0° azimuth) \n",
    "  * Left (-90° azimuth)\n",
    "\n",
    "DATA FLOW:\n",
    "1. Load participant-specific design CSV (specifying which trial gets which stimulus)\n",
    "2. Load base box breathing audio (meditation instructions)\n",
    "3. For each trial in the design:\n",
    "   a. Determine exact sample position based on reference timestamps\n",
    "   b. Add controlled randomization (jitter)\n",
    "   c. Insert appropriate spatial audio stimulus\n",
    "4. Save personalized audio file and detailed logs of stimulus timing\n",
    "\n",
    "EXPECTED USE:\n",
    "The generated audio files will be used in experiments where participants:\n",
    "1. Listen to the personalized box breathing audio through headphones\n",
    "2. Follow the breathing instructions\n",
    "3. Experience the spatial audio stimuli during specific breathing phases\n",
    "4. Potentially respond to these stimuli (reaction time measurements)\n",
    "5. Data will help understand how PPS perception might change during different \n",
    "   breathing phases\n",

    "# PPS Practice Stimulus Generator - Concise Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "This code generates short practice stimuli for a Peripersonal Space (PPS) experiment with these key features:\n",
    "\n",
    "### What it Creates:\n",
    "- 5 different randomized versions of practice stimuli\n",
    "- Each version includes two synchronized audio files:\n",
    "  1. A file containing looming sounds (approaching from left/front/right)\n",
    "  2. A file containing tactile stimuli (vibrations)\n",
    "- CSV log files documenting precise stimulus timing\n",
    "\n",
    "### Content Structure:\n",
    "- Each version contains 12 trials with 4-second intervals between them:\n",
    "  - 4 baseline trials (tactile vibration only)\n",
    "  - 4 catch trials (looming sound only) \n",
    "  - 4 PPS trials (both looming and tactile with random SOA)\n",
    "- Different randomized order in each version\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Approach:\n",
    "- Creates short audio files (approximately 1-2 minutes)\n",
    "- Maintains precise synchronization between paired audio files\n",
    "- Uses random SOA (Stimulus Onset Asynchrony) for PPS trials\n",
    "- Includes trial timing information in CSV logs for verification\n",
    "\n",
    "The program outputs all files to the specified directory, ready for use in participant practice/training sessions."
